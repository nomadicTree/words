word: Object
levels: [KS5]
definition: >
  A unit of encapsulated data (attributes) and behaviour (methods). An object is the 'thing' that exists in memory with attributes and can execute its class's methods.
characteristics:
- Has its own values for its class's attributes
- Can call methods defined in its class
- Is created using the constructor of its class
- Multiple objects can be created from the same class
examples:
- |-
  In Python, lists are objects:
  ```python
  names = ["Justice", "Simon", "Ash"] # a list object, an instance of the built-in list class
  names.append("Shirley") # using the append method on the list object with the identifier 'names'
  ```
- |-
  BankAccount objects are instances of the BankAccount class:
  ```python
  class BankAccount:
    # constructor
    def __init__(self, p_account_number):
      self.account_number = p_account_number
      self.balance = 0

  b = BankAccount(12345) # creates a BankAccount object, an instance of the BankAccount class
  ```
non_examples:
- 'Instance: ''instance'' describes the relationship of an object to its class; every
  object is an instance, but ''instance'' refers to the relationship, not the actual
  thing in memory'
- 'Class: a blueprint from which objects are created'
