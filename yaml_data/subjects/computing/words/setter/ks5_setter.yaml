word: Setter
definition: A method that changes the value of an object's attribute.
characteristics:
- Provides controlled write access to an attribute without exposing the attribute directly
- Usually named with the `set_` prefix, e.g. `set_name()`
- Supports encapsulation by controlling how hidden data is modified
- Typically changes the value of a `private` attribute
- Often paired with a getter
- May include logic (e.g., validation or formatting) before changing the attribute
examples:
- |-
  ```python
  class Student:
    # constructor
    def __init__(self, p_name):
      self.__name = p_name

    # setter
    def set_name(self, new_name):
      # validation with a length check
      if len(new_name) > 0:
        self.__name = new_name
  ```
non_examples:
- Directly changing a public attribute, e.g., `student.name = "Jemima"`
- Any method that returns the value of an attribute without changing the attribute
