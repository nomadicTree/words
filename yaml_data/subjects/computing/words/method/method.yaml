word: Method
levels: [KS5]
definition: A subprogram defined within a class that operates on the data of an object and defines the class's behaviour.
characteristics:
- Defined inside a class
- Can access and modify the class or object's attributes (even if they are `private`)
- Called using dot notation on an object, e.g., `object.method()`
- 'Can be `public` or `private`, controlling access to the method: `private` methods may only be called in other methods within the class'
- Can take parameters
- Can return values
- In Python, the first parameter is always `self` (this parameter is always required in the method signature but is not given arguments)
examples:
- Constructors
- Setters
- Getters
- |-
  Other subprograms defined within a class
  ```python
  class BankAccount():
    # constructor, a method
    def __init__(self, p_account_number):
      self.account_number = p_account_number
      self.__balance = 0 # a private attribute that should only be changed by methods

    # get method (getter), public method
    def get_balance(self):
      return self.__balance

    # set method (setter), public method
    def set_balance(self, new_balance):
      self.__balance = new_balance

    # public method
    def deposit(self, p_amount):
      self.set_balance(self.__balance + p_amount) # using the set_balance method within another method

    # private method
    def __withdraw(self, p_amount):
      if p_amount >= self.__balance:
        self.set_balance(self.__balance - p_amount)
        return self.get_balance() # methods can return values
  ```
non_examples:
- 'Class: defines the blueprint of an entire object, not just its behaviour'
- 'Attributes: these are data associated with a class'
