word: method
levels: [KS5]
definition: A subprogram defined within a class that implements part of the class's behaviour.
characteristics:
- Can access and modify private attributes defined in the same class
- Called using dot notation on an object, e.g., `object.method()`
- 'Can be `public` or `private`, controlling access to the method: `private` methods may only be called in other methods within the class'
- Can take parameters
- Can return values
- In Python, instance methods take `self` as their first parameter (this parameter is always required in the method signature but is not given arguments)
examples:
- Constructors
- Setters
- Getters
- |-
  Other subprograms defined within a class (Python)
  ```python
  class BankAccount():
    # constructor, a method
    def __init__(self, p_account_number):
      self.account_number = p_account_number
      self.__balance = 0 # a private attribute that should only be changed by methods

    # get method (getter), public method
    def get_balance(self):
      return self.__balance

    # set method (setter), public method
    def set_balance(self, new_balance):
      if new_balance < 0:
        raise ValueError("No debt allowed!")
      self.__balance = new_balance

    # public method
    def deposit(self, p_amount):
      self.set_balance(self.__balance + p_amount) # using the set_balance method within another method

    # private method
    def __withdraw(self, p_amount):
      self.set_balance(self.__balance - p_amount) # use the balance setter to update the balance
      return self.get_balance() # methods can return values
  ```
non_examples:
- 'Class: defines the template of an entire object, not just its behaviour'
- 'Attributes: these are data stored in a class or object'
