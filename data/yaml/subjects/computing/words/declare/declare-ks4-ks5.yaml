word: declare
definition: To introduce a variable by giving it an identifier and reserving space in memory, without assigning it a value.
characteristics:
- Establishes the variable's identifier and (sometimes) its data type
- Separates identification from assignment in languages like C, C++, and Java
- 'Not required in all languages: in Python, variables never need to be introduced before they are initialised'
examples:
- 'Declaring a variable of type `int` in C: `int x;`'
- 'Declaring a variable in JavaScript: `let x;`'
non_examples:
- 'Initialising a variable: `x = 5`'
- |-
  Updating the value of a variable (in C)
  ```c
  int x; // declaration
  x = 5; // initialisation
  x = 10; // assignment
  ```
