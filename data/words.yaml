  - word: Casting
    definition: Converting a value from one data type to another.
    characteristics:
      - Changes the data type of a value (e.g., int to float, string to int)
      - 'Common functions: `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`'
    examples:
      - 'int to float: `float(5)` &rarr; `5.0`'
      - 'float to int: `int(3.14)` &rarr; `3`'
      - 'int to string: `str(5)` &rarr; `"5"`'
      - 'string to float: `float("2.1")` &rarr; `2.1`'
      - 'bool to string: `str(True)` &rarr; `"True"`'
      - 'int to bool: `bool(0)` &rarr; `False`'
      - 'int to bool: `bool(1)` &rarr; `True`'

      - 'Assignment: `x = 5`'
      - 'Concatenation: `"hello " + "world"`'
